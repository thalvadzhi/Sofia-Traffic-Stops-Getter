## Installation
> Note this code only works with python 3.* 

First run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

If you have more than one python version installed, to use python 3's pip instead run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Prerequisites

The script expects to find a config file named `configuration.config ` in the following format:

```
[git-repo]
repo_path = <PATH_TO_FOLDER_CONTAINING_GIT_REPO>

[coord]
coord_file_name = <COORDINATE_FILE_NAME>.json

[log]
log_file_name = <LOG_FILE_NAME>.log

[notification]
key = <KEY>

```
Repo path is the path to the repo to which you want to upload the coordinates file. < KEY > is the key generated by the Notify android app.

The git repo should have its user.name and user.email set. Also it expects that the username and password for the remote repo are stored.

## Usage

To get all stop information run `python line_coordinates.py`

The script accepts two command line options:

`-u` - upload the results(if changed from previous run) to github.

`-p` - push notification to phone(when results have changed).

The script will generate a < LOG_FILE_NAME >.log file containing information about when it tried to obtain stop data and when it found that the data has changed and tried to upload it to github. Also the log will contain which stops have changed.

## Bonus

To clean the log file once a month and run the script once a day use the following jobs in cron:
```
0 0 1 * * rm <PATH_TO_REPO>/<LOG_FILE_NAME>.log
0 0 * * * cd <PATH_TO_REPO> && python3 <PATH_TO_REPO>/stops_getter/line_coordinates_getter.py -u -p
0 0 * * * cd <PATH_TO_REPO> && python3 <PATH_TO_REPO>/descriptions_getter/directions_getter.py
```
